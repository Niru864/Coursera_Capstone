Introduction and Business Plan
Mississauga is a city in the province of Ontario, west of Toronto - the provincial capital. Due to its proximity to Toronto, it is the sixth most populous city in Canada and it is popularly known to be a multi-cultural and a diverse city. I want to explore the multiculturalism and diversity of the city of Mississauga by exploring the restaurants and gather the insights using the tools of Foursquare API, and City of Mississauga Neighbourhoods data.  I want to explore the different variety of restaurants and use k-means to understand the restaurant clusters. 

Why Mississauga? As an immigrant to Canada, my family moved to Mississauga and it is home to many landed immigrants to Canada. I want use restaurants as a measure of the diversity in the city of Mississauga. 

Mississauga was initially called Toronto Township when it was purchased from the First Nations people (called Mississaugas) for 1000 pounds in 1805 but it wasn’t until 1974 that it was called Mississauga. Toronto is among the three cities in Canada that attracts nearly 70% of the immigrant population. Though historically most immigrants to Canada were from Europe, recently more numbers are observed from Asia, including Middle East Asia. 

Canada is a country shaped by its immigrants and their descendants. Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal attract nearly 63% of the immigrant population, with most visible minorities living in urban centres, and Mississauga specifically has 53.7% visible minorities. As of 2011, the three largest visible minorities in Canada are South Asians, Chinese and Blacks and as of 2016, South Asian followed by Blacks and Chinese are the top 3 visible minorities in Peel Region. Mississauga accounts for 52% of the Peel region’s population. Knowing this information, I want to compare the types of restaurants in Mississauga and see if the multicultural characteristic of the city is reflected in the diversity of the restaurants.
